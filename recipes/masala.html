    <ul>
        <li>580g pack chicken breasts, cut into 3cm chunks</li>
        <li>3 tbsp Tikka Masala Spice Paste</li>
        <li>15g pack coriander, roughly chopped</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tsp vegetable oil in a large, nonstick frying pan over a high heat. Add the chicken and fry for 6-8 mins, turning occasionally, until evenly golden. Add the spice paste to the pan, stir to evenly coat the chicken, then add the tomatoes and 100ml boiling water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 10 mins, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through, the tomatoes have started to break down and the sauce has reduced by roughly a third.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and mix in 120g yogurt and the coriander, saving a little to garnish, until you have a thick, creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve sprinkled with the remaining coriander, yogurt and a generous grind of black pepper.</li>
